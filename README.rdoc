Bike There

Bike There is the first major project I've completed during the 12-week Web Development Immersive program at General Assembly. 

Bike There is inspired by my love for riding my bike around the San Francisco Bay Area and the pain of facing on an unexpected hill.
Bike There is built on Google Directions API and uses Google Elevations API to retrieve the elevation information along any bike route.
